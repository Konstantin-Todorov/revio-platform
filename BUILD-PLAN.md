# Revio — Build Plan

Order of work toward the Channel Manager demo. Each phase ends in something runnable.

---

## 🗺️ REMAINING PLATFORM WORK (roadmap, 2026-07-05)

All four products (RevioLink · RevioCRS · RevioPMS · Operator) are **built and live**, on one shared DB.
Cross-product Channex auto-push works (a CRS/PMS change pushes immediately). What's left, by area:

**Distribution / connectivity**
- **Channex production certification** — engineering done; remaining is the form + live screenshare
  (founder's process). See `docs/CHANNEX-CERTIFICATION.md`.
- **Scheduled auto-pull** — pull OTA bookings on a timer (today it's on-demand / on-edit). Needs the
  scheduler infra below.
- Per-client real OTA channels — each needs that OTA's own credentials (a per-hotel onboarding step).

**Infrastructure (unblocks several items above)**
- **Scheduler / cron + worker** for background jobs: CRS hold-expiry, pickup snapshot, FX refresh, sync
  retry, scheduled Channex pull; PMS automated night-audit. Today they're lazy/in-process + CRON_SECRET
  routes. Externalize with Railway cron or a worker (+ optional **Redis + BullMQ** for the sync queue →
  also powers queue-depth on Operator → Platform Health).
- **Email / notifications** — CRS reservation-delivery + arrival emails; operator alerts. Needs a provider.

**Data / security**
- **RLS Phase 2 (prod enforcement) — LAST.** Switch prod to the restricted `revio_app` role so every
  `tenant_isolation` + `operator_only` policy (CM · CRS · PMS · Invoice · ConnectivityCredential) actually
  enforces. One pass covers all four products. Runbook in `DEPLOY.md`. (On prod today the role is superuser
  → policies are inert but correct.)
- Drop the unused `ProductMapping` table (superseded by two-stream mapping).
- ~~Add `@types/node` to `packages/db`~~ — done 2026-07-26; `pnpm -r typecheck` is clean.

**Deploy / ops**
- **reservation-service auto-deploy** — the Railway service now shows repo `Konstantin-Todorov/revio-platform`
  + branch `main` connected with "Auto deploys when pushed to GitHub" **enabled** and Wait-for-CI off
  (founder screenshot 2026-07-22). Being re-verified with a live push; if it still doesn't fire, the
  fallback is a manual deploy (`railway up --service reservation`, or the Railway MCP `deploy` tool).

**Per-product polish / V2**
- CM: channel logos (cosmetic); Settings reservation-delivery emails (needs email infra).
- CRS: Excel/PDF report export (CSV shipped); scheduled report emails.
- PMS: automated nightly Close Day (manual today); lock/key hardware integration; hostel bed-mode UI;
  registration-card fields at check-in.
- Operator: real **Stripe** billing (mocked today — no live payments); an operator audit-log screen.

**Go-live readiness (founder directive 2026-07-22 — "we are close to first clients")**
- **Production-readiness pass across all four products** — ✅ **round 1 done 2026-07-26.** Swept every
  screen of all four apps against a brand-new tenant with no seed data (tenant + owner + one rate plan,
  exactly what the Operator provisions). Delivered: a first-run **setup checklist** on each product's
  dashboard (steps in `@revio/core/onboarding`, shared card in `@revio/ui/setup-checklist`, completion
  recorded once on `Property.setupCompleted` so it never reappears); **honest day-one status** on the
  RevioLink dashboard (no more "Healthy · all channels connected · queue empty — all delivered" with
  zero channels); missing empty states (Channels, Reservations, Room Types ×2, Inventory Calendar, both
  Bulk screens, dashboard tables); **room-type CRUD in RevioCRS** — previously a CRS-only hotel had no
  way to define what it sells, which broke the sold-separately promise; and removal of dev-facing copy
  (`@revio/core` mentions, `§` spec refs, "all 5 phases live", "Demo · mock connectivity" → the real
  connection state, unused `Placeholder` components).
  **✅ Round 2 done 2026-07-26** (commit `8a4078c`): **server-action authorization** — RevioPMS hid
  screens from scoped roles but did NOT gate the writes behind them (a server action commits before
  the layout re-guards), so a housekeeper/outlet account could post a payment, void a line, check a
  guest out or issue an invoice via a crafted POST. Every money/occupancy/config action now requires
  a capability (`manage` · `frontDesk` · `housekeeping` · `maintenance` · `outlet`), policy pinned by
  10 tests in `apps/pms/lib/roles.test.ts`, proven end-to-end (same POST: 200 + row as owner, 303 +
  no row as housekeeper). Plus **error/loading/404 boundaries** in all four apps (there were none —
  `@revio/ui/status-page` + `@revio/ui/skeleton`), **eight tables** that scrolled the page sideways on
  a phone wrapped, and **numeric bounds** (commission/FX markup accepted negatives).
  Still open for a later round: a broader responsive pass beyond the phone-critical screens, and
  server-side validation messages (today several actions fail closed silently).
- **Email engine** — per-hotel branded templates (logo, sender name, phone, reply-to), per-email-type
  on/off toggles, and editable content, so each hotel controls what its guests receive. Research how
  competing engines do it; build on our own sending system.

**Websites (new — see `docs/POSITIONING.md`)**
- Build **4 marketing sites**: one general (routes to each product) + three product sites (Link / CRS /
  PMS), each with a small cross-sell section for the other two. Content is drafted in `docs/POSITIONING.md`.

**Future products**
- ~~Direct **Booking Engine** (consumer-facing) — parked as a future product.~~ **Un-parked and in
  build since 2026-07-27 — see Phase K at the bottom of this file.** K1–K4 shipped (a guest can book
  end to end, locally); K5–K9 open.

## 📍 WHERE WE ARE (2026-06-26) — read this first if resuming

**Live & working** (GitHub auto-deploys `main`):
- **RevioLink (CM)** → https://channel-manager-production-59bb.up.railway.app — behind login.
- **Operator Console** → https://operator-production-5eed.up.railway.app — behind login.
- **Repo** https://github.com/Konstantin-Todorov/revio-platform · **Railway** project `revio-platform`
  (services `channel-manager`, `operator`, `Postgres`; per-service build/start config — NO root railway.json).
- **Auth done** (email+password, JWT cookie). Demo logins (pw `revio1234`): RevioLink
  `admin@hotelsofia.demo` / `owner@blacksea.demo`; Operator `operator@revio.app`.
- **Empty-hotel crashes fixed**; operator can onboard a client (org+Owner+property+entitlements+base rate).
- **Client self-service DONE** — in RevioLink Settings the Owner/Admin invites staff (role select +
  remove, tenant-scoped, role-gated in `lib/actions-users.ts`) and adds properties (chain support).

**✅ MOBILE LAYOUT FIXED in BOTH apps (2026-06-26).** The shell is now responsive: `Sidebar` is a
slide-over drawer under `lg` (backdrop + X + close-on-navigate) driven by a `ShellContext`; `Topbar`
has a hamburger (`MobileMenuButton`) shown only `< lg`; wide tables wrap in `overflow-x-auto` so the
page never overflows. Verified at 375 / 768 / 1280px in both channel-manager and operator. CRS/PMS now
inherit a correct responsive shell pattern (copy `components/shell/{ShellContext,MobileMenuButton}.tsx`
+ the Sidebar drawer + Topbar hamburger wiring).

**✅ RLS HARDENING — built & verified locally (2026-06-26); prod = a deliberate Phase 2 (see below).**
DB-level tenant isolation now exists as defense-in-depth on top of app-level scoping. Pieces:
- Migration `20260626130000_enable_rls`: `ENABLE`+`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + a `tenant_isolation`
  policy on every tenant table, keyed on `app.tenant_id` (hotel) / `app.bypass='on'` (operator/system).
  Child tables (`RatePlanRoomType`, `ReservationLine`, no `tenantId`) isolate via an `EXISTS` check on
  their RLS-protected parent. `Tenant` keys on its own `id`.
- `packages/db/src/rls.ts`: `forTenant(id)` / `forSystem()` wrap each model op in a txn that sets the
  GUC transaction-locally (canonical Prisma RLS pattern; safe under pooling).
- CM: a per-request proxy `lib/db.ts` forwards `prisma.x.y()` to the session's tenant client → only the
  *import* changed in data/action files, not the ~100 call sites. Identity (`session`,`actions-auth`)
  uses `forSystem()`. Operator uses `forSystem()` (cross-tenant) everywhere.
- **RLS only enforces against a NON-superuser role** (superusers/`BYPASSRLS` ignore it; `FORCE` only
  reaches the owner). Local: created `revio_app` via `packages/db/prisma/rls-role.sql`; apps' `.env`
  connect as it; `packages/db/.env` (owner) is used by migrate/seed.
- **Verified locally:** as `revio_app` — no GUC → 0 rows; tenant A → only A; bypass → all; cross-tenant
  INSERT rejected ("violates row-level security policy"); cross-tenant UPDATE → 0 rows. App reads + a
  real "Simulate booking" write work; operator sees all tenants; tests core 18/18 + db 3/3 pass.
- **Prod rollout is Phase 2 in `DEPLOY.md`** (create `revio_app` on Railway, split migrate-owner vs
  runtime-restricted via `directUrl`, switch `DATABASE_URL`, verify, rollback-ready). Pushing the code
  alone is behaviour-neutral in prod (the Railway role is a superuser → policies bypassed until flipped).

**Real connectivity ≠ data loss:** demo content is DB data; real connectivity is an adapter swap
(Mock → real `ChannelAdapter`, same interface). Demo tenants keep `MockChannelAdapter`; real tenants get
real adapters; they coexist. Never point a real adapter at demo hotels.

**▶️ ROADMAP — V2 revisions (founder spec `docs/CM-REVISIONS.md`, 2026-06-27).**
Done & deployed: ✅ mobile/responsive shell · ✅ RLS (shipped inert in prod) · ✅ manual mapping editor ·
✅ Channex adapter **built + live-verified against the sandbox** (`@revio/connectivity`, local commits,
not yet wired into the app or deployed).

**Recommended order — settle the data model FIRST so we don't build twice (rationale below):**

- ✅ **Phase 1 — Core model — DONE + deployed** (a) inventory date-level (`totalRooms` safety-net;
  Rooms-to-sell + derived Rooms-sold); (b) currency on Property + conversion prompt + the 4 CRS FX
  fields per reservation; (c) rate-plan Min/Max stay + Advance-Purchase rolling-close.
- ✅ **Phase 2 — Two-stream mapping — DONE + deployed.** Room-Type stream (inventory/open-close) +
  Rate-Plan stream (rates/restrictions), mirroring Channex. ProductMapping kept but unused (cleanup later).
- 🟡 **Phase 3 — Wire real Channex — mostly done.**
  ✅ 3a: real ARI push via `@revio/connectivity`, opt-in per channel (`Channel.connectivityMode`:
  mock default | channex_sandbox | channex_prod), Re-sync button, mode+UUID in channel settings.
  ✅ 3b: **auto-push on every ARI edit** (recordPush → syncRealChannels; no-op for mock), **pull**
  (`pullChannel`: 7-day lookback, dedupe on externalId, cancel/modify update in place — derived sold
  self-corrects availability, unmapped → failed_import + Error Center, overbooking flagged, re-push
  after import; "Pull bookings" button per channel), **24h sync-health bar** on channel cards.
  ✅ 3c: **operator-managed encrypted keys** — `ConnectivityCredential` (AES-256-GCM via
  `@revio/db` encryptSecret/decryptSecret, key = `CONNECTIVITY_SECRET` env → AUTH_SECRET fallback;
  set on both Railway services), bypass-ONLY RLS policy (hotels see zero rows), Operator
  Connectivity screen (set/replace/remove, last-4 hint only), CM resolves per-tenant key first,
  env fallback. ⬜ Remaining: (i) scheduled auto-pull (needs cron/queue infra — pair with the
  Phase 5 email/notifications infra); (ii) import-loop live test needs a Channex-sandbox test OTA
  channel with a real booking.
- ✅ **Phase 4 — Calendar & IA redesign — DONE + deployed (2026-07-02).** Calendar = ALL room types as
  collapsible sections (`getCalendarBoard`), 7/14/30-day movable window + jump-to-date (2-yr horizon),
  Rooms filter + Customise-display row groups (`ParamMultiSelect`), Rooms-sold derived row, editable CTA.
  **+ Month-calendar view option (2026-07-02, filters added same day)**: Grid | Month toggle; one
  collapsible month calendar per room type (first open), SAME Rooms + Customise-display filters as the
  grid (sold line, min-stay badge, stop/CTA/CTD dots toggle via the shared rows param), month picker +
  prev/this/next within the 2-yr horizon; day cells edit Sell + Rate via the same saveCell logic.
  **Bulk Update merged with Restrictions** (one screen; /restrictions redirects).
- ✅ **Phase 5 — Screen refinements — mostly DONE + deployed (2026-07-02).** Sync Center absorbed Error
  Center + Audit Log as tabs (+error badge; /errors,/audit redirect); Reservations filters (guest/#,
  channel, status, check-in range); **User Management = own Operations screen** (/users; Settings keeps a
  pointer). ⬜ Remaining: channel logos (cosmetic), Settings reservation-delivery emails + arrival
  notifications (**needs email + scheduler infra** — pair with scheduled auto-pull).
- ⬜ **Channex certification prep (before production keys).** *(unchanged — scheduled after RevioCRS)* Channex requires passing their **PMS
  certification** (docs.channex.io → pms-certification-tests): 14 scenarios run from OUR REAL UI against
  the staging sandbox, task IDs submitted via form, then a live screenshare review → production access.
  Gaps to close when we schedule it: (a) **full-sync = 500 days in ≤2 API calls** (our Re-sync pushes 14
  days); (b) **delta-only pushes** (test 13 — our auto-push resends the whole 14-day window per edit);
  (c) **booking acknowledgments** on pull (test 11); (d) demonstrate rate-limit compliance. Note: the
  hotel's Channex account lives on **staging.channex.io** (app.channex.io is a separate production login).
- **▶️ IN PROGRESS — RevioCRS** (founder spec **v2** captured 2026-07-02 → `docs/CRS-REFERENCE.md`: exact
  metric formulas, Hold lifecycle, modification rules, 4-level restriction priority, date-sensitive
  OOO/closure inventory, permission groups, performance targets, and its own 5-phase MVP order —
  property foundation + pickup-snapshot job → reservations/holds → rates → dashboard/metrics →
  distribution). Binding rules: `ChannelManagerConnector` adapter (RevioLink-internal = shared core,
  no network; third-party = push/pull later); **availability waterfall once in `@revio/core`**
  (Physical−OOO−Closed−Holds−Confirmed — CM's date-level inventory is the collapsed form); ONE metrics
  module read by Dashboard + Reports. Same shell/auth/DB; `hasReservation` entitlement gates it;
  new tables carry tenantId + RLS policy; third Railway service.
  - ✅ **Phase 1 done (2026-07-03) — inventory foundation.** `computeWaterfall` + `expandInventoryPeriods`
    + `SOLD_STATUSES` in `@revio/core` (tested; CM's 4 sold-status filters now import the shared constant);
    **full CRS data model settled in ONE migration** (`crs_data_model`): RoomInventoryPeriod, Hold, Guest,
    BookingSource, TaxFee, PickupSnapshot, PropertyDefaults, PermissionRole/RoleAccess — all with
    tenant_isolation RLS (verified cross-tenant = 0 rows) — plus Reservation extensions (nullable
    channelId/externalId for staff-entered bookings, guestId, bookingSourceId, paymentGuarantee label,
    cancelledAt, line priceMinor/guestsCount) and Channel.bookingSourceId. Third app `apps/reservation`
    (port 3002, cookie `revio_crs_session`, gated on `hasReservation` — both demo tenants now entitled):
    Dashboard (tonight's waterfall cards, low-availability watch, periods, snapshot status), **Inventory
    Calendar** (Physical/OOO/Closed/Available/Sold/Remaining per room type × date, manual-override dot),
    **Inventory Setup** (physical counts + OOO/closure period CRUD with audit + sync events). **Pickup
    snapshot job** live from day one: lazy-triggered per property-timezone day on Dashboard/Inventory
    loads + `POST /api/jobs/pickup` (CRON_SECRET-gated) for scheduled runs; rows only where sold > 0.
    Verified end-to-end on dev (add period → availability drops on exactly the inclusive range → delete
    restores; audit + sync rows written).
  - ✅ **Phase 2 done (2026-07-03) — Reservations + Holds.** The **Hold mechanism**: Availability Search
    (call-center entry — guest-stay query over every room type at once, prices from the standard plan,
    alternative + upgrade labeling) → "Hold & continue" locks inventory INSTANTLY (active Hold row with
    PropertyDefaults.holdTtlMinutes TTL, default 30) → step-2 guest form converts the hold into a
    confirmed reservation (guest record reused by e-mail, 4 currency fields, payment-guarantee label,
    line priceMinor/guestsCount, audit + sync event). Lifecycle actions: **modify** = validate-new-first
    with own line excluded — if any night doesn't fit, NOTHING changes (verified); **cancel** restores
    availability instantly (derived sold) + sets cancelledAt; **no-show** gated to after the check-in
    date (property TZ). **Hold-expiry job** (lazy on reservation pages + `POST /api/jobs/holds`,
    CRON_SECRET) releases stale holds and expires their draft/hold reservations. **Guests**: list/search,
    detail with contact + special-requests editing + booking history (scope line: not a CRM).
    Reservation detail = stay/guest cards + **Timeline** (audit pre-filtered by `#<id6>` tag) + inline
    modify. **CM now pushes the FULL waterfall**: `buildAriUpdates`, the pull overbooking check, and
    manual-booking validation all subtract OOO/closures/active holds via `computeWaterfall` — a CRS
    hold or OOO period takes rooms off sale on every channel on the next push. Gotcha fixed: the RLS
    proxy doesn't forward `$transaction` (model ops only) — actions use sequential ops.
  - ✅ **Phase 3 done (2026-07-03) — Rates & Restrictions.** `resolveRestriction` in `@revio/core` now
    has the spec's **4th level** (`propertyDefault`, tests 34/34); `RestrictionRule.sourceCategories`
    (migration `restriction_source_scope`) scopes rules by booking source — verified live: the seeded
    "Trade fair — closed to Travel Agents" stop-sell blocks Travel Agent searches while Call Center
    books the same dates. CRS **/rates screen**: Rate Plans CRUD (ported CM dialog — same shared
    tables/engines), Restriction Rules CRUD (+ source-scope checkboxes), **Property defaults form**
    (level-4 fallback + hold TTL). Inventory Calendar gained the spec's last two rows: **Rate**
    (inline-editable standard-plan price → same RatePrice rows the CM pushes; derived plans recalc)
    and **Restrictions** (4-level resolved min-stay badge + stop/CTA/CTD dots). **Enforcement at the
    point of sale**: `stayViolation()` (stop-sell any night, CTA on arrival, min-LOS, rolling
    advance-purchase — all source-scoped) gates both the Availability Search (shows "restricted" +
    reason) and `placeHold`. Verified: level-4 AP min=3 blocked next-day stays across all room types;
    level 3 correctly shadows level 4 (Standard's defMinLos=1 beats a property min of 2). **CM pushes
    now apply the property-default fallback too** (minLos/maxLos/CTA/CTD/stop-sell/AP in
    `buildAriUpdates`).
  - ✅ **Phase 4 done (2026-07-03) — Dashboard & Metrics.** **Formula sheet ONCE in `@revio/core`**
    (`metrics/formulas.ts`, 44/44 tests): room-nights w/ range clipping + prorated accommodation
    revenue, occupancy, ADR, RevPAR (= ADR × occupancy, asserted), headline + room-night cancellation
    rates, LOS, lead time, pickup, gross/net (− channel commission), no-shows-as-sold toggle.
    `lib/metrics.ts` assembles DB → formulas (capacity = physical − OOO − closed; verified to the
    room-night against SQL). **Dashboard**: date selector (Today/Tomorrow/7d/30d/MTD/YTD/custom)
    driving every widget, 8 metric cards, occupancy+revenue day charts, source-mix share bars,
    **Action Center** (thresholds = Settings incl. new `lowAvailabilityThreshold`), **Forecast**
    (7d/30d, same data read forward), arrivals/departures today, new+cancelled 24h. **Reports** (5:
    Performance / Pickup & Pace / Source / Cancellation / Availability) each with **CSV export**
    (`/api/reports/export`, session-gated; Excel/PDF later). **Global Search** wired into the topbar
    (guest/phone/email/company/room/channel/source/status → /search). Defaults form gained the metric
    settings (no-shows toggle, gross/net, pickup offset, alert threshold).
  - ✅ **Phase 5 done (2026-07-03) — Distribution + Settings. RevioCRS V1 COMPLETE (all 5 phases).**
    `ChannelManagerConnector` in `@revio/core` (47/47 tests): the interface + `RevioLinkInternalConnector`
    (push = no-op acknowledgement — shared inventory core; third-party CMs implement the same interface,
    one integration pattern) + `createCmConnector` factory. CRS **/distribution**: Connected-CM card
    (internal transport explained), channels read-only table, recent sync activity, unresolved errors —
    per-OTA config stays in the CM (spec rule). CRS **/settings**: **Users & Permissions matrix** (the 8
    groups × None/View/Edit; 5 built-in V1 roles seeded — Owner/Admin/Revenue Manager/Reservations
    Agent/Read-only; custom roles = configuration via savePermissionRole; built-ins protected), staff
    list (managed in RevioLink — one account across products), **Taxes & Fees CRUD** (percent|fixed,
    basis, included|excluded), property profile summary. Gotcha re-hit: `"use server"` files export
    async functions ONLY → `PERMISSION_GROUPS` moved to `lib/permissions.ts`.
- **Then — Channex certification prep** (see the prep item above): do it AFTER RevioCRS, BEFORE the
  first real client goes live — cert has external lead time (Channex schedules a live screenshare), so
  don't leave it to the last minute; testing continues on the staging sandbox meanwhile.
- **▶️ IN BUILD — RevioPMS** (operations layer: front desk, housekeeping, minibar). Spec confirmed with
  the founder → `docs/PMS-REFERENCE.md` (rooms-first; PMS owns the new physical **Unit**; payments =
  labels+balance only; night audit = manual "Close Day"; Guests reuse the CRS record; 6 new tables;
  metrics stay in the CRS core sheet). Same pattern, `hasPms` gate, 4th Next app `apps/pms` (port 3003,
  cookie `revio_pms_session`).
  - ✅ **Phase 1 done (2026-07-04) — Units & Housekeeping.** Migration `pms_units_housekeeping`: `Unit`
    (physical room/bed under a RoomType, housekeeping status) + `HousekeepingTask` + nullable
    `RoomInventoryPeriod.unitId`, both new tables with tenant_isolation RLS. **The one cross-product
    write:** a Unit going `out_of_order` writes a RoomInventoryPeriod → the shared availability waterfall
    takes the room off sale on every channel; serviceable again deletes it (verified bidirectionally,
    DDR 12→11→12). Screens: Front Desk (HK status cards + today's arrivals/departures/in-house from the
    shared reservation record), Housekeeping board (floor-grouped, mobile/PWA status control), Rooms
    setup (add / bulk-generate / delete Units). Units seeded for both demo hotels; `hasPms` on. Prod
    build green. **Deployed live 2026-07-04: https://pms-production-a64b.up.railway.app** (4th Railway
    service `pms`; auto-deploys on push; migration applied on prod; `hasPms` + units backfilled).
  - ✅ **Phase 2 done (2026-07-04) — Front Desk.** `RoomAssignment` (line ↔ unit + checkedInAt/Out) —
    reservation sold-status unchanged, stay state derived. check-in (unit assignment + override),
    check-out (unit→dirty), room move, walk-in (same-day confirmed direct stay → reduces waterfall).
    Screens: Front Desk hub + /checkin/[id] + /walkin + /move/[assignmentId]; housekeeping occupancy
    overlay. Verified end-to-end via real server actions; deployed live.
  - ✅ **Phase 3 done (2026-07-04) — Folio & Billing.** `Folio` + `FolioLine`; a folio opens at
    check-in/walk-in seeded from the reservation (accommodation = line price → bill matches CRS revenue;
    excluded taxes/fees per basis; prepaid-OTA auto-settles). Post charge (minibar/extra/fee), take
    payment (label + amount only, no card data), void (flagged). **Check-out gates on balance** (blocks
    unless override, logged) + closes the folio. Screens: /folios + /folio/[reservationId]. Verified
    end-to-end; deployed live.
  - ✅ **Phase 4 done (2026-07-05) — Minibar / POS.** `PosItem` catalog (minibar|extra) + tap-to-post to
    a stay's folio (a FolioLine of the item's kind). Screens: /minibar (occupied rooms) →
    /minibar/[reservationId] (mobile tap-to-post) → /minibar/catalog (CRUD). Seeded catalog; verified
    end-to-end; deployed live.
  - ✅ **Phase 5 done (2026-07-05) — Maintenance + Close Day. REVIOPMS V1 COMPLETE.** `MaintenanceTask` +
    `Property.businessDate`; a maintenance task can flag a room out-of-order (shared `lib/units.ts` OOO
    helpers → the waterfall) and completing it returns the room as Dirty. Manual "Close Day" night-audit
    auto-marks un-arrived reservations as no-show and rolls the business date. Screens: /maintenance +
    /closeday. Verified end-to-end; deployed live. **All 5 PMS phases built, tested, live.**
- **RLS Phase 2 (prod enforcement) LAST** so one migration pass covers every product's tenant tables
  (`DEPLOY.md`).
- **The operator (us) stays the admin over everything**: Operator Console provisions clients + flips
  CM/CRS/PMS entitlements + holds encrypted connectivity keys; hotels self-manage staff/properties.
  All four apps = one Postgres, one `@revio/core`, one access model (`ACCESS-MODEL.md`).

**Why not wire/deploy Channex right now:** Phases 1–2 change the very things Channex depends on — the
inventory model (what "availability" means), the currency (what we send), and the mapping structure (the
two streams). Wiring Channex before them = building it twice. The adapter being done means Channex is
de-risked and ready to plug in **after** the model settles.

**Connectivity test plan (test live API keys BEFORE any real client).** It's an adapter swap — the
`ChannelAdapter` interface + `MockChannelAdapter` already isolate it, and the adapter is chosen **per
tenant** (demo hotels stay on Mock; others get real adapters; they coexist — no data loss). Steps:
(1) implement `ChannexChannelAdapter` (same interface); (2) use **Channex sandbox + test API keys**
(stored encrypted in the operator's connectivity keys, per tenant, never shown to a hotel); (3) make a
dedicated internal **TEST tenant** ("Revio Test Hotel") wired to the real adapter pointed at the Channex
sandbox; (4) run the full ARI loop against sandbox (push ARI → verify in Channex's sandbox → make a
sandbox test booking → confirm the pull decrements availability → re-push); (5) only after the sandbox
loop is green + Channex certification, point a real client's tenant at the production adapter with their
real keys. Never point a real adapter at a demo hotel. Per-tenant mode flag: `mock | channex-sandbox |
channex-prod`, so one deployment serves all three at once.

**Minor cleanup noted:** `packages/db` has no `@types/node`, so its `tsc --noEmit typecheck` fails
("Cannot find type definition file for 'node'") — pre-existing, doesn't affect build/tests/app
typechecks. Add `@types/node` to `packages/db` devDeps when convenient.

**Also pending:** Billing (Stripe), Platform Health, operator Settings — fill in as their systems land.

**How to run/deploy:** `pnpm --filter @revio/<app> dev` (CM 3000, operator 3001). Seed/inspect remote DB
from local via Postgres `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`. Push to `main` = auto-deploy both. Local DB `revio_dev`;
tests DB `revio_test`. Full detail in `CLAUDE.md`, `ACCESS-MODEL.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, and memory.

---

## ✅ Phase 0 — Foundation (done)
- Monorepo (pnpm workspaces), nested `CLAUDE.md` system, TS config.
- `@revio/core`: domain types + availability + derived-rate + restriction engines + channel adapter
  interface + mock adapter. Core math verified.
- `@revio/ui`: design tokens from the Atlas palette.
- Architecture & decisions recorded.

## ✅ Phase 1 — Data layer & demo seed (done)
- `@revio/db`: Prisma schema for all core entities + monitoring (Sync/Error/Audit), `tenantId`
  everywhere. Pushed to local Postgres 16 (`revio_dev`). *(RLS policies: raw-SQL migration, pending.)*
- Seed reproduces the **reference screenshot on live dates**: Hotel Sofia, 6 room types, 7 rate plans
  (Standard manual; Non-Refundable/Breakfast/Long-Stay/Trip.com/Corporate/Early-Booker derived via
  `@revio/core`), 4 channels + 168 mappings (5 unmapped), 720 daily prices, reservations, sync/error/audit.
- Verified: derived engine yields the screenshot's exact NR/Breakfast rows; current week matches
  availability `12,12,10,8,6,6,8`, Friday stop-sell, Saturday CTD.

## ✅ Phase 2 — Channel Manager app shell (done)
- Next.js `@revio/channel-manager` (RevioLink) on `localhost:3000`. Navy chrome, property selector,
  sectioned left nav, all 12 routes wired. Tailwind + Hanken Grotesk + Atlas tokens. All routes 200.

## 🟡 Phase 3 — Core screens (the demo spine) — mostly done
- ✅ **Dashboard** (health cards + channel status + recent activity + quick actions + reservations).
- ✅ **Calendar** (ARI grid, room-type tabs, 7/14/30d, derived rates computed live, flags) — read-only.
- ✅ **Rooms & Rates**, ✅ **Channels** (mapping %), ✅ **Reservations**, ✅ Sync/Error/Audit (read).
- 🟦 Remaining: **inline cell editing** on the Calendar; Bulk Update / Restrictions / Mapping / Settings
  forms (currently wired-to-data placeholders).

## ✅ Phase 4 — Operational + editable screens (done)
- CRUD: **Rooms & Rates** (room types, rate plans incl. derived config + tags), **Restrictions**
  (rule builder), **Mapping** (per-channel + auto-fix), **Channel Settings** + connect channel,
  **Settings** (property form + users). **Bulk Update** (mass edits). Calendar **inline cell editing**.
- **Reservations** (read-only + cancel), **Sync Center**, **Error Center**, **Audit Log** render data.
- Every mutation: server action → `@revio/core`/`@revio/db` → Audit entry → mock push (Sync Center).

## ✅ Phase 5 — Live loop (done)
- "Simulate booking" → import (pull) → availability drops → re-push; cancel restores; overbooking
  onto a sold-out date is flagged + raised in the Error Center. Verified end-to-end in the browser.
- Tests: core 18/18 (vitest) + `@revio/db` integration 3/3 against `revio_test`.

## ✅ Phase 6a — Railway deploy (done)
- RevioLink live at https://channel-manager-production-59bb.up.railway.app on Railway (`revio-platform`
  project, one Postgres). Prisma Migrate runs on deploy. **GitHub auto-deploy on push to `main`** —
  proven end to end. Repo: https://github.com/Konstantin-Todorov/revio-platform.

## 🟡 Phase 6b — Operator Console (App 4, in progress)
- `apps/operator` (@revio/operator): all hotels overview, create client (org + owner + entitlements),
  toggle entitlements + plan per client, cross-tenant sync health. Operator perimeter (sees all tenants).
- Deploys as a second Railway service on the same Postgres; auto-deploys on push.

## Later (post-demo)
- Real connectivity (Channex first, then direct OTA adapters), per channel, behind the same interface.
- Reservation/CRS (Booking Engine, payments, folio, reports).
- PMS (front desk, housekeeping PWA, minibar).

## 🟡 Phase K — RevioDirect, the booking engine (K1–K4 done, 2026-07-27→30)

Spec: `docs/specs/BOOKING-ENGINE-DESIGN.md` §6, governed by the founder's `BOOKING-ENGINE-ADDENDUM.md`.
App: `apps/booking` (port 3004) — read `apps/booking/CLAUDE.md` first; it is the only unauthenticated,
internet-facing, inventory-touching surface we have, and its rules are different from the other four.

| Task | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K1 | ✅ | Public app shell, slug → property choke point, one generic 404 for every "no", per-IP **and** per-property hold rate limiting. |
| K2 | ✅ | Step 1 — range calendar, guests, **all-in pricing** from the tax/fee rules. |
| K2b | ✅ | *Not in the original plan.* Full UX/UI overhaul after the founder rejected the first pass: type system, calm-precision tokens, two-month range calendar, pinned collapsing search bar, four-step progress. |
| K3 | ✅ | Room content model — `RoomTypePhoto` + `@revio/storage` + `sharp` re-encode; CRS upload screen; Step 2 cards with honest scarcity. |
| K4 | ✅ | Step 3 — hold-on-open (15 min, id in the URL, own hold excluded on confirm), guest details, **card guarantee**, confirmation page + branded email. |
| K7 | ✅ | *Shipped early, out of order* — the CRS **Booking Engine** screen (slug, on/off, preset → colour/headings/logo/hero, live preview) was needed to demo K2b at all. |
| K5 | ⬜ | **Stripe Connect onboarding** in CRS Distribution + request-to-book fallback when unconnected. |
| K6 | ⬜ | Returning-guest recognition (email → shared guest record, opt-out respected, GDPR-clean). |
| K8 | ⬜ | Direct-vs-OTA analytics incl. commission saved. |
| K9 | ⬜ | Deploy — own Railway service, `book.revio.app`, object-storage bucket. |

**Two deviations from the spec worth knowing.** K4 planned the guarantee "via Stripe Connect"; it
shipped on the **platform's own test-mode SetupIntent** through `@revio/payments` instead, because
Connect onboarding is a hotel-facing flow with its own screens and belongs with K5 rather than being
smuggled into the guest checkout. And the design doc's sequencing note was right — **K3 was the
sleeper**: photos meant object storage, an upload pipeline, an image processor and a hotel-facing
editor, none of which existed.

**Not built, deliberately:** real card collection (needs Stripe Elements + a live-mode decision),
extras/upsell (the step-3 slot exists and is empty), and Operator visibility into the booking engine.

**Blocked on the founder before a real hotel can go live:** each hotel's Stripe Connect account, a
sending domain (#127), and — in Bulgaria — the fiscalization gate from F3 (which the guarantee model
defers to the hotel's point of sale, since no money moves at booking).
