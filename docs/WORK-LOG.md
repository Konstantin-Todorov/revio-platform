# Work log — who is doing what

**The only channel between agents.** Codex and Claude cannot see each other's sessions; this file is
how each finds out what the other is doing. See `AGENTS.md` §5.

**Claim before you start. Mark done when you finish. Read it before you begin anything.**

Newest at the top. Keep entries short — the commit message carries the detail.

Format:
```
### YYYY-MM-DD · <agent> · <status> · <area>
**<one line: what>**
Files: <the ones you are actually in>
Notes: <anything the other agent needs — a decision, a gotcha, a dependency>
```
Status: `CLAIMED` · `DONE` · `BLOCKED` · `ABANDONED` (say why).

### 2026-08-26 · Codex · DONE · Operator platform history
**Adding a curated milestone ledger and a prioritised Now / Next / Later launch roadmap.**
Files: `apps/operator/app/(protected)/platform-history/page.tsx`,
`apps/operator/lib/platform-history{,.test}.ts`, `apps/operator/components/shell/Sidebar.tsx`,
`apps/operator/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/WORK-LOG.md`
Notes: isolated worktree and branch `codex/operator-platform-history`; no database, core, guest,
connectivity or deployment changes. The history is versioned metadata, not a runtime Git reader.
Full workspace typecheck, tests, builds, root lint and copy-lint passed on `c490784`.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · DONE · CRS F2 — guest merge
**Extracting guest merge + duplicate detection to `@revio/core`, then adding the CRS half.**
Files: `packages/core/src/guests/merge.ts` (new), `apps/pms/lib/{actions-guests,guest-identity}.ts`,
`apps/reservation/**/guests/**`
Notes: merge already exists in the PMS only. Extracting because a second caller has appeared — and it
fixes four things on the way: the merge is **not transactional** (four sequential writes, so a failure
half-merges), duplicate detection **loads every guest in the property** and is then called twice per
profile, the contact back-fill duplicates `hydrateGuestContact`, and it can copy an OTA alias onto the
winner without carrying `emailIsOtaAlias`. **Done — guests are free.** Two things before touching them: the merge rules live in
`@revio/core/guests/merge.ts` and BOTH products call them, so change them there and never in an app;
and an OTA relay address must never match on email — two guests can hold `x@guest.booking.com` and be
different people.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · DONE · CRS F4 — guest contact hydration
**Enrich-empty / never-overwrite / tag-OTA. `packages/core/src/guests/contact-hydration.ts`, 16 tests.**
Files: `packages/core/src/guests/contact-hydration.ts`, `packages/booking/src/public-engine.ts`,
`apps/reservation/app/(protected)/guests/[id]/page.tsx`, `Guest.emailIsOtaAlias` (migration `20260826140000`)
Notes: the spec said hydrate "from the most recent linked reservation" — **`Reservation` has no
contact fields**, so the source is the booking being made. The bug it fixes: matching a returning
guest by email short-circuited and threw away the phone they had just typed. Never-overwrite is what
makes it safe to run unattended; do not relax it. OTA relay domains are a fixed list, not a
heuristic — a false positive tells a hotel a real address is fake.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · DONE · coordination
**`AGENTS.md` + this log, so two agents can share the repo.**
Files: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/WORK-LOG.md`
Notes: `AGENTS.md` is the file Codex loads by convention; it points at `CLAUDE.md` rather than
duplicating it. §1 and §2 are the eight code traps and the two Channex traps that have each already
cost real time here — worth reading once even if the rest is skimmed.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · DONE · website (spec section I)
**All nine website items — I1 through I9.** Repo: `revio-websites`, deployed.
Files: `revio-websites/src/pages/{about,security,compare,how-it-works,index}.astro`,
`src/config/{approaches,offer,site,journey}.ts`, `astro.config.mjs`
Notes: the named `/vs/[brand]` pages are retired; `/compare` compares approaches and the old URLs
301 to it. Two copy claims were **wrong in our own disfavour** and are fixed: the security page said
2FA was not live (TOTP has shipped on the operator console), and a proof line claimed "a real
Bulgarian fiscalization path" we deliberately do not have.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · DONE · Channex onboarding
**A hotel can put itself on Channex from the product; the mock-channel trap is closed.**
Files: `packages/connectivity/src/channex-{provision,channel-api,channels}.ts`,
`apps/channel-manager/lib/actions-connect.ts`,
`apps/channel-manager/components/channels/{ProvisionChannex,ConnectChannelDialog}.tsx`,
`apps/channel-manager/app/(protected)/channels/page.tsx`
Notes: the Channels screen now has **three** states — on Channex / demo tenant / neither. The
two-state version silently offered the MOCK dialog to a real hotel, which fabricates external ids
and produces a channel that says connected and sells nothing. Do not collapse it back to two.
`Channel.externalChannelId` is new (migration `20260826120000`).

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · DONE · auth + PMS
**Four bugs found by using the product.**
Files: `packages/ui/src/{set-password-fields,login-fields}.tsx`, `apps/*/lib/actions-account.ts`,
`apps/*/components/auth/*`, `apps/pms/lib/{actions-auth,shifts,workforce}.ts`
Notes: setting a password did not clear an existing session, so a manager setting up a new staff
account landed back in their own. PMS sign-in sent every role to `/dashboard`, which a scoped role
may not open — the layout redirected again and the chained redirect produced a white screen. Shift
history is now readable (`summariseShifts`); it was recorded and displayed nowhere.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · DONE · fiscalization
**Read Наредба Н-18 properly; the July research was wrong.**
Files: `packages/core/src/fiscal/receipt-requirement.ts`, `apps/pms/lib/fiscal.ts`,
`docs/specs/BG-FISCALIZATION-RESEARCH.md`
Notes: **bank transfer is exempt** (чл. 3 ал. 1), so most hotel money needs no fiscal receipt at
all. СУПТО is voluntary and we are declining it. `fiscalizeInvoice` used to stamp a fabricated
`NRA-…` seal on real tax invoices — now demo tenants only.

## Open — not claimed by anyone

Pull one of these rather than inventing work, and claim it above first.

| Item | Where | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **E2** two-month range picker, arrival→departure | CRS | tracker §E |
| **F5** *(do nothing)* no charts on a guest profile | CRS | recorded so nobody adds them |
| **J1** verify mark-paid and write-off report separately | PMS | verification, may be a no-op |
| **H1–H14, K1–K8** occupancy-based pricing | all | **parked by agreement, sequenced last** — do not start without saying so |

## Standing facts worth not rediscovering

- Production Channex account: **0 properties** as of 2026-08-26, verified with a real key and a 200.
  An unauthenticated request returns 401 with no `data` key — do not read that as "zero".
- The full production path is proven: property → room type → rate plan → availability push → rates
  push, all clean, then deleted. **What has never run is connecting a real OTA** (Booking.com
  authorisation), which is the first live test.
- Live services: `cm` · `operator` · `crs` · `pms` · `booking` `.reviosoft.app`, all `/api/health`.
